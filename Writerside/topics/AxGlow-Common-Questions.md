# Common Questions

### Why has my name changed colors?
- This is unfortunately how minecraft works when you have a glow with a color. If this bothers you, you can try using some kind of custom nameplate plugin.

### Can I use AxGlow to add a glow to npcs?
- No, however almost all npc plugins have a builtin way to apply colors! Some examples:
  - FancyNpcs: /npc glowing &lt;name> &lt;color>
  - Citizens: /npc glowing --color &lt;color>

### Can I still give players normal glowing effects?
- Yes, the `/effect give <name >minecraft:glowing` command will continue to work.

### Is it possible to make glows that aren't static or rainbow?
- Yes! You can create your own glow in the glows folder where you can set which colors should be used, and you can even set how often should the color change.

### Will everyone see my glow?
- Yes, unless they have set their /axglow visibility to only show their own color, then everyone will be able to see.
