# Add To Blocks

**Recommended use case:** (holograms are currently not part of the plugin)

![image_6.png](image_6.png)

- With the `/axvaultsadmin set \[number]` command you can put down vaults on blocks!
- The vault will be put on the block that you are looking at!
- How does this work? If you for example run `/axvaultsadmin set 1`, the plugin will add the #1 vault to the block, when players click on the block, it will basically do the same thing as the /axvaults 1 command.
- If you use the `/axvaultsadmin set` command, the vault selector will be added to the block!
- Opening vaults from blocks will bypass the `axvaults.openremote` and `axvaults.selector` permissions!

> Recommendations: 
> - Use this feature in the spawn world to motivate players to store items in vaults!
> - Set the `axvaults.openremote` and `axvaults.selector` permissions to false and force players to open their vaults on the spawn.
