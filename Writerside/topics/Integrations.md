# ü™ù Integrations

* We have our own [**AxIntegrations** library](https://github.com/Artillex-Studios/AxIntegrations/tree/master), which allows us to support plugins easily!
* If you are a developer, feel free to open a pull request adding your plugin! If you are adding a paid plugin, make sure to turn it into an [empty (stub) jar](https://github.com/Artillex-Studios/JarStubGenerator).
* Note that it is almost impossible trying to keep all of these hooks up to date and functional, so if you notice any issues, plaase report them!
