# Common Questions

### Why doesn't X booster boost the give command?
- Most of the time the plugin doesn't provide a way for this, also even if they would, this is not a good idea as players can usually use a pay command to send currency between each other, and that would cause infinity money glitches.

### Why would a +50% booster give 1.5x the money/xp?
- We have an in-depth explanation of this [**here**](AxBoosters-How-Multiplier-Works.md)!

### Why is X booster not working?
- Firstly make sure that you are using the right booster, for example there are many plugins that have sell prices.
- Make sure that you have set the booster to use that booster hook, you can search for issues with /axboosteradmin debug.
- Double check if you are using the booster correctly! Did you activate it? (in the /booster menu) Is this booster even supposed to do that? (for example most mobcoin boosters will only boost the mob kill mobcoins)
- If this still doesn't work, report this issue on our [discord server](https://dc.artillex-studios.com/) (and tell us the plugin that use use and it's version)
