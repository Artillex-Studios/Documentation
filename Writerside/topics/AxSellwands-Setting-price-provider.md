# Setting price provider

**The plugin supports a lot of [external shop plugins](AxSellwands-Supported-Plugins.md), if you don't want to use the builtin price system, you can change the price provider with a couple of simple steps:**
- Navigate to the plugins/AxSellwands/hooks.yml file
- Open the hooks.yml file and search for the economy-plugin or price-plugin sections (they are the first 2)
- Set this value to the plugin of your choice, the list of supported plugins can be found [here](AxSellwands-Supported-Plugins.md)!
