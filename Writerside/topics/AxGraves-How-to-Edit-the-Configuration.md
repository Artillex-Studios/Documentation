# How to Edit the Configuration?

**You can edit settings (like despawn time and messages) mentioned in [Configuration](AxGraves-Configuration.md) in a couple of simple steps:**
- Navigate to the **plugins/AxGraves** folder, here you can find the config.yml and the messages.yml
- Open the one that you would like to modify and you can make your changes.
- One you have changed everything that you wanted, make sure to save the file and run /axgraves reload
- It is useful to understand YAML syntax, but don't worry, we provide useful information in the console if something goes wrong.
