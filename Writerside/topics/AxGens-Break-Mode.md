# Break Mode
* This feature is disabled by default, and it must be enabled in the config for it to work!

### What is break mode?
* Enabling break mode gives all generators a health and they must be broken X times to give their drop.
* In break mode you also need to `shift + left click` to pick up generators.

### Setup recommendations
* The `%\next-spawn%` placeholder will be the health of the block and `%\spawn-time%` is the max health in break mode.
* You should change all texts that refer to any time unit to health of something similar.
* You should also consider the [breaking speed of blocks](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Breaking) when creating tiers! The default config may not be balanced for break mode.
