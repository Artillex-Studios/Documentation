* You must stay in the koth zone for x seconds without getting knocked out. The winner is the player, who can stay in for the whole capture time.

[SCORE](AxKoth-Score.md)
* For every second a player stays in the zone, they will gain 1 point (only 1 player can get points at once) - if you get knocked out, the points stay and after either the time runs out or you reach a set time, the winner will be the player with the most points.
