# Creating Zones

### Steps of creating a new zone:
- Get the selection wand with /axafkzone wand
- Select the region (left click is position 1, right click is position 2)
- If you selected the cuboid region, write /axafkzone create name-of-zone (replace name-of-zone with the name you want to give to the zone)
- This is all, now go to `plugins/AxAFKZone/zones/name-of-zone.yml` and add your rewards!
