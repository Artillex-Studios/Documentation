# Configuration

## Want to add a new envoy?
Create a new .yml file in the envoys folder, and copy the contents of the default.yml. That's it.
You have created a new envoy! You can change it freely!

## Want to add a new crate?
Create a new .yml file in the crates folder, and copy one of the crates' config. 
To add it to an envoy, you need to go into the envoy's file and add your crate's name to the crates section,
with the chance of spawn you'd like. (The name of the crate is the name of the .yml file!)
