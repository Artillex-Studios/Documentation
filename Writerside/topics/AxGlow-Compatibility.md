# Compatibility

* Plugins that interact with minecraft's builtin teams system can cause issues.
* Usually these are scoreboard/tab plugins.

### Supported Plugins:
- [TAB](https://modrinth.com/plugin/tab-was-taken) (both V4 and V5)

### Other Plugins
- If you are using another tablist plugin, you can try to add compatibility by adding the %\axglow_color% placeholder before the player's tab nametag.
- If you aren't sure about compatibility with a tablist plugin, feel free to ask us on discord!
