# ️Work In Progress

**Some plugins are still in development, but they already have a wiki page.**

Why is there a wiki if the plugin is not ready yet? It speeds up our work process as different people work on the plugin's code and the page designs.

### Progress
* Not often updated, might not be accurate
* This page might also include some work in progress plugin rewrites or major updates

**Status Symbols:**

⭐ Under testing or working on page design\
🐛 There are some bugs that need fixing\
🔎 Most features are ready, but still missing a few key things\
🔨 In development\
❌ Development paused or not started

*This list might include some plugins that have never even been mentioned publicly, so note that these plugins might never release, or it may take months. There is no ETA.*
