## What is AxCosmetics?
- AxCosmetics is a plugin, with which your players can be given
cosmetics like backpacks, custom item skins or custom armors, which they can use.

## Built-in cosmetics
- The plugin contains support for the following cosmetic types:
  - Backpacks
  - Custom armors
  - Main/off-hand cosmetics
  - First-person backpacks, which have different views for the equipper, and the other viewers

## What are first-person backpacks?
- They allow for having backpacks, which are different for the equipper, and the other viewers.
- This allows for having backpacks which are not seen in the default perspective for the equipper,
while allowing them to see their cosmetics from an "F5" view.

## Why choose AxCosmetics?
- This plugin is built for high performance.
- The plugin is different from other cosmetic plugins, because it is an inventory-style cosmetic
plugin, where the cosmetics of the user are stored in an inventory. This allows for having multiple
cosmetics of the same type. These cosmetics can have an "edition", a counter describing how many
other cosmetics of this type exist already.
