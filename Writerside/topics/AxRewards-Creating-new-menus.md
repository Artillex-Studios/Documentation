# Creating new menus

You can find all the menus in the plugins/AxRewards/menus folder.

To create a new one, all you need to to:
- Copy one of the existing menus (if you don't have it, you can take one from [our github](https://github.com/Artillex-Studios/AxRewards/blob/master/src/main/resources/menus/default.yml))
- Give it a different name
- Make sure to change the `open-commands` section
- Change the rewards (if you want)
- Reload the plugin with /axrewards reload

And this is all, the new menu will be avaliable with the /axrewards open &lt;menu> command (or with the command you defined)
