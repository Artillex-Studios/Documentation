### Symbols:

🔎 Currently not supported, however support is coming soon
🔨 Currently not supported, however there is a previous version that supports this minecraft version\
❌ Currently not supported, and it might never be (if it is a newly released version, we will add support soon)

🪶 Folia Support (even plugins marked with supporting Folia might have issues, but feel free to report them)

⭐ All plugins support Spigot/Paper/Pufferfish/Purpur, we can't guarantee compatibility with other forks.
However if they are based off one of the previously mentioned forks, they will most likely work.
There is also no guaranteed support for modded platforms.

### Some notes:
- Our core library ([AxAPI](https://github.com/Artillex-Studios/AxAPI)) uses NMS, which means that we have to push an update for (almost) every new minecraft update.
- 1.18.X support was dropped because the command library used by us dropped/broke support at some point.
- 1.19.X support was dropped when we switched our AxAPI library to Java 21.
