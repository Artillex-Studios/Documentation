# Supported Plugins

## Booster Hooks

### Builtin
```yaml
  vanilla:damage
  vanilla:flight
  vanilla:flyspeed
  vanilla:experience
```

**Potion effect booster hooks:**

`vanilla:potion_<name>`
- all the vanilla potions work (from /effects)
- [https://minecraft.wiki/w/Potion#ID](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Potion#ID)
- instead of multipliers, they are amplifiers
- for example, a potion with +200% multiplier will be a lvl 3 potion (because +0-99% is lvl 1)
- examples: Night Vision, Jump Boost, Speed, Haste & many more

**Attribute booster hooks:**

`vanilla:attribute_<name>`
- all the attributes work (from /attribute)
- [https://minecraft.wiki/w/Attribute](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Attribute) (note that a lot of attributes are only available on 1.21)
- examples: Mining Speed, Walking Speed, Player Scale & many more
> Some attributes might not work on players! (check the wiki link above to see which ones work)

**Some plugins that we will never be able to add:** (there are some exceptions to these)
- economy plugin like vault, as they only manage the economy, not give currency to players (however, we can add other plugins, like shop plugins)
- we can't boost commands, (what could command * 1.5 look like?) time based things (like reward cooldowns)
- closed source plugins without a public API jar
- plugins that only have give/pay commands, because we can't prevent abusing boosts by paying currency to each other
