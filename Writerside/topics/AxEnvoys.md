# AxEnvoys

# What is AxEnvoys?

An envoy/supply crate plugin with performance, and configurability in mind.

# Features:
* Create as many envoys as you want! They can even be running in parallel!
* Great performance
* Extensive configurability
* ItemsAdder/Oraxen custom block support
* Flares
* Fireworks on spawn
* Random spawns, pre-set spawns
* Message overwriting/envoy (For example, you can create an envoy that's prefixed "Envoys", and one that's prefixed "Damn son!")
* And much, much more!
