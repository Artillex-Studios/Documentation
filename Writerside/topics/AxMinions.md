# AxMinions

## What is AxMinions?

AxMinions is a plugin, that works on Spigot (and it's forks) & Folia, to make 
the gameplay of your server more interesting.

Imagine the following situation: You are playing on a server, but it's really difficult to get money. What do you do?
You place down a forager minion, and plant trees, so it can harvest them, and you don't have to do anything.

## How do you get AxMinions?

The installation is simple. All you have to do, is put it in the plugins folder, and reboot your server.
After the restart, if you have the correct permissions, you can give yourself a minion. *It's that simple.*
