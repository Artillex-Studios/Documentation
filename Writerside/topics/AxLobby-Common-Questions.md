# Common Questions

### Can this plugin handle everything that I need in a lobby?
- It depends on the use case, generally we suggest using some other plugins alongside with AxLobby.
- Some of our modules are not super complicated, so a plugin made for that specific reason would always be better.
- For example, we suggest using a separate chat plugin recommended by your permission handler plugin.
- But theoretically, only using AxLobby is 100% possible.

### What other plugins are supported by AxLobby?
- [PlaceholderAPI](https://hangar.papermc.io/HelpChat/PlaceholderAPI): Almost every text field can use placeholders, also the chat module requires it
- Vault: the chat module requires it if you want to use ranks

### Why is there no anti world download module?
- There is no way to detect modern world downloading tools. Only one old mod sent a message that notified servers, most new ones don't.
